<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lisa Steytler. I am learning to develop a website so that I can build a modern website for our company without incurring exhorbitant costs.</p>

<p>I still have a lot to learn. I have never had any IT training and everything that I know, to date, has been self taught and using google for various questions that I have had.</p>

<p>I am finding it quite challenging in trying to balance time to practice coding and running a business with customers and staff often requiring my time. So, alas, the studies have been slotted into any private time that I have over weekend and after hours. I am sure that the sacrifice will yield positve results. Holding thumbs, fingers and toes!</p>
